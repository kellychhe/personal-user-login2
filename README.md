# Job Posting Site with Auth

This is a job site where a user can log in and post job listings by submitting a form with the job, location, recruiter contact, company description, job description, requirement, etc. The user can also delete the listing or they can indicate that the position is filled (it will highlight the post as red). Other users can comment on the job post.

## Languages Used

This was created using EJS, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Node.js.

The first screenshot is the submission form and the second is where the jobs are displayed. I used CRUD and bootstrap to build this web application. I used Node and JS to allow users to log in or sign up for an account.  The user accounts are stored on MongoDB along with all the job posts. 

## Lessons Learned

In this project, I learned how to add comments by using another post request that updates and pushes new comments into the database.
